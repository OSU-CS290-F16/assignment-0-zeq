<h1>Coding Blog</h1>
<h2>Assingment 0</h2>
<p>I have formulated a procedure for coding projects which this assignment fit rather smoothly into. Essentially, I look up how what I think I need works, then I set up a test version to learn the ins and outs of it myself, then I decide whether it actually accomplishes what I need, and either implement it or do a broader search to find what I need. In this project, I first played around with what was easiest to edit html files with. This led to a hiccup where work didn't actually get saved, and I finally settled on Notepad++. I might change that later. Afterwards, I played around with headers, paragraphs and lists to find a formatting I liked most, part of which involved looking up the exact formatting for a list. Then finally, I looked up the formatting for an image tag, and played around to see where I could pull images from. For this case, I figured it would be easiest to host the image on imgur, though I suspect that will change in the future. It seems that my engr password is broken or something, so I will be unable to complete the last portion of the assignment until I hear back from support.</p>
